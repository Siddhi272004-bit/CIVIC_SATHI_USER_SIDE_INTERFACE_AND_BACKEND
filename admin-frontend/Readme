Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v14 or later recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager)

Getting Started 🚀
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the main project repository to your local machine.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/READSAM/CIVIC_SATHI.git
cd CIVIC_SATHI/admin-frontend
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the admin-frontend directory and install all the required npm packages.

Bash

npm install
3. Set Up Firebase Configuration
This application connects to a Firebase project to fetch and display data. You need to provide your Firebase project's configuration credentials.

Create a new file in the admin-frontend/src/ directory named .env.

Copy and paste the following into the .env file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials. You can find these in your Firebase project settings.

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
Note: This .env file is included in the .gitignore and will not be committed to the repository, keeping your credentials secure.

4. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and the Firebase configuration is set, you can start the React development server.

Bash

npm start
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any edits to the code.
